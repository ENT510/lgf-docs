# Raycast Class

The `LGF.RaycastHandler` module provides methods for performing raycasts and identifying nearby players. These functions are useful for interacting with the game environment and selecting entities or players.

```lua
---@module
LGF.RaycastHandler
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Note:** Each interaction involving the raycast requires a loop with a 0 Thickness, to ensure continuous updates and responsiveness within the game environment.
</Callout>



### LGF.RaycastHandler:performRaycast

- This function conducts a `raycast` originating from the player's current `position`, projecting in the direction the player is `facing`. It determines if the ray intersects with any `entities` within a specified `maximum distance`, allowing for interactions with the game `environment`.

```lua copy
---@param maxDistance number The maximum distance to which the ray should extend.
---@param drawMarker boolean Whether to draw a marker at the hit location.
---@param drawLine boolean Whether to draw a line to the hit location.
---@return boolean hit Whether the ray hit an entity.
---@return entity entity The entity that was hit, if any.
---@return table hitCoordinates The coordinates of the hit point {x, y, z}.
---@return table surfaceNormal The normal of the surface at the hit point {x, y, z}.
LGF.RaycastHandler:performRaycast(maxDistance, drawMarker, drawLine)
```

### Example Usage

```lua copy
CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        Wait(0) -- Required (0 thick)
        -- Perform a raycast with a maximum distance of 50 units
        local hit, entityHit, hitcoords, surfaceNormal = LGF.RaycastHandler:performRaycast(50.0, true, true)

        if hit then
            print("Hit Entity:", entityHit)
            print("Hit Coordinates:", hitcoords)
            print("Surface Normal:", surfaceNormal)
        else
            print("No entity hit. Coordinates of raycast destination:", hitcoords)
        end
    end
end)
```

### LGF.RaycastHandler:performTargetPlayer

- This function locates the `nearest player` within a defined `radius`. If the raycast successfully hits the targeted player, a `visual marker` is displayed above their `head`, facilitating easy `identification` and `interaction` with that player in the game `world`.


```lua copy
---@param distanceMax number The maximum distance to search for players.
---@param markerType number The type of marker to draw above the targeted player's head.
---@param drawLine boolean Whether to draw a line to the targeted player.
---@return table|nil coordinates The coordinates of the targeted player {x, y, z}, or nil if no player is found.
---@return entity|nil closestPlayer The entity of the closest player, or nil if no player is found.
---@return number|nil playerId The server ID of the targeted player, or nil if no player is found.
LGF.RaycastHandler:performTargetPlayer(distanceMax,markerType, drawLine)
```

### Example Usage

```lua copy
CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        Wait(0) -- Required (0 thick)
         -- Perform targeting of the closest player within a maximum distance of 20 units
        local coords, entity, playerId = LGF.RaycastHandler:performTargetPlayer(20.0, 2, true)

        if coords then
            print("Targeted Player ID:", playerId)
            print("Coordinates of Targeted Player:", coords)
            print("Entity of Targeted Player:", entity)
        else
            print("No player within range.")
        end
    end
end)
