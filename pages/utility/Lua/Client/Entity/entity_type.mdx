# Entity Documentation

This documentation outlines how to obtain entities within the game environment.

## Returned Table Structure

When you retrieve entities using the provided functions, each entry in the returned table contains the following fields:

- **EntityID** (number): The unique identifier for the entity.
- **EntityHash** (number): The hash of the model used for the entity.
- **netid** (number): The network ID of the entity.
- **coords** (vector): The coordinates where the entity was created.

  - `model` (string): The model name of the pedestrian.
  - `position` (vector3): The spawn position of the pedestrian.
  - `scenario` (string, optional): The scenario the pedestrian will perform.
  - `freeze` (boolean, optional): If true, the pedestrian's position will be frozen.
  - `isNetworked` (boolean, optional): If true, the pedestrian is networked.
  - `invincible` (boolean, optional): If true, the pedestrian is invincible.
  - `blockingEvents` (boolean, optional): If true, blocking events for the pedestrian are enabled.

### Returns

- `createdPed` (entity): The created pedestrian entity.

### Example Usage

```lua copy
local newPed = LGF:CreateEntityPed({

    position = vector3(100.0, 100.0, 30.0),
    scenario = "WORLD_HUMAN_MOBILE_FILM_SHOCKING",
    freeze = false,
    isNetworked = true,
    invincible = true,
    blockingEvents = false
})
```

### Example Usage

```lua copy
local newVehicle = LGF:CreateEntityVehicle({
    model = "adder",
    position = vector3(250.0, 250.0, 30.0),
    isNetworked = true,
    seatPed = true,
    seat = -1,
    freeze = false,
    onCreated = function(vehicle)
        print("Vehicle created with ID:", vehicle)
    end
