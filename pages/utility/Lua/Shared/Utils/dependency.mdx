# Get Dependency

`LGF:GetDependency()` verifies whether a specific resource is loaded and if its version matches the required version. This function is essential for ensuring that dependencies are correctly managed and compatible in your application.


```lua copy
---@param resource_name string
---@param required_version string
---@return boolean, string
LGF:GetDependency(resourceName, version)
```

### Parameters

- **`resource_name`** (string): The name of the resource whose status and version you want to check.
- **`required_version`** (string): The version of the resource that is required for compatibility.

### Returns

- **`boolean`**: `true` if the resource is running and the version matches the required version; `false` otherwise.
- **`string`**: A message indicating the result. If `false`, the message explains why the dependency check failed.

### Usage

To use `LGF:GetDependency()`, call the function with the resource name and the required version. The returned boolean and message can be used to handle resource dependencies dynamically. Hereâ€™s how you might use it:

```lua copy
local LGF = exports['LGF_Utility']:UtilityData()
LGF:GetDependency("LGF_Utility", "1.2.3")
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the resource name and version are correctly specified to get accurate results.

- This function is useful for managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility across different parts of your application.
