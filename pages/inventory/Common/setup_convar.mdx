# ConVars Setup

This document explains the configuration variables (ConVars) used to set up the inventory system. These ConVars allow for customization on the shared, client, and server context.

## **Shared ConVars**

These are global settings applied across all players and instances of the inventory system.

```lua copy
--Maximum number of inventory slots each player can have
setr lgf_inventory:maxSlotInv 50

--Maximum weight a player can carry in their inventory
setr lgf_inventory:maxInvWeight 40

--Enable debug mode (1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled)
setr lgf_inventory:enableDebug 1

--Enable random item drops in trunks (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
setr lgf_inventory:randomDropTrunks 1

--Enable random item drops in dumpsters (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
setr lgf_inventory:randomDropDumpsters 1

--Max Wheigt For Single Drop
setr lgf_inventory:maxDropWheight 20
```

## **Client ConVars**

These settings affect the individual player's client, such as keybindings, UI preferences, and visual effects.

```lua copy
--Enable screen blur effect (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
setr lgf_inventory:screenBlur 1

--Model for dropped items
setr lgf_inventory:dropModel "hei_prop_drug_statue_box_big"

--Show item sprite on dropped items (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
setr lgf_inventory:enableSpriteDrop 1

--Keybind for hotbar toggle
setr lgf_inventory:hotbarKey "f9"

--Keybind for inventory toggle
setr lgf_inventory:inventoryKey "f3"

--Enable Ammo Charger DUI (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
setr lgf_inventory:enableAmmoChargerDui 1
```

## **Server ConVars**

These settings control server-side features, such as how often inventory data is saved. They allow the server to adjust performance and backend features.

```lua copy
--Inventory data save interval in seconds
set lgf_inventory:save_interval 120
```
