# Client Events

## Current Weapon Data

- This event is triggered whenever a weapon is equipped or removed. It returns a table containing details about the currently equipped weapon, including its ammo count, weapon hash, and item details.

```lua
RegisterNetEvent("LGF_Inventory:weapon:CurrentWeapon", function(weaponData) end)
```

### Expected Behavior:

- If the weapon is currently equipped (i.e., in hand), the event will return the details of that weapon.
- If the weapon is holstered (not in hand), the event will return an empty table.
