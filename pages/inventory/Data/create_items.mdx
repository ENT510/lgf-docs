#Creating New Items

- This guide explains how to create new items for your game by defining their attributes in the shared/items.lua file. Each item is represented as a table with various fields to determine its properties, behavior, and interactions within the game.

## Structure of an Item

- Each item is represented by a table with the following fields:

```lua
---@class Item
---@field slot number
---@field itemWeight number
---@field quantity number
---@field itemName string
---@field itemLabel? string
---@field itemType? string
---@field itemRarity? string
---@field description? string
---@field closeOnUse? boolean
---@field metadata? table
---@field durability? number
---@field usable? boolean
---@field throwItem? boolean
---@field onUse? fun(item: Item): void
---@field exports? { client?: { resourceName: string, exportName: string }, server?: { resourceName: string, exportName: string } }
```

## Fields for Defining Items

Hereâ€™s what each field represents when defining an item:

- **`itemName`** (string):  
  The unique identifier for the item. This is how the item is referenced in the code.

- **`itemLabel`** (string):  
  The display name of the item visible to players.

- **`itemType`** (string):  
  Defines the type of item. The valid types are:

  - `"item"`: Standard consumables or materials.
  - `"weapon"`: Weapons that players can use.
  - `"ammo"`: Ammunition for weapons.

- **`itemRarity`** (string):  
  Specifies how rare the item is. Common values include:

  - `"common"`
  - `"uncommon"`
  - `"rare"`
  - `"epic"`
  - `"legendary"`

- **`description`** (string):  
  A brief description of the item, explaining its use or properties.

- **`stackable`** (boolean):  
  Whether the item can be stacked in the inventory. Relevant for consumables, materials, or items that are used in large quantities.

- **`itemWeight`** (number):  
  The weight of the item, affecting inventory management and carrying capacity.

- **`quantity`** (number):  
  The number of items of this type in the inventory (relevant for stackable items).

- **`closeOnUse`** (boolean):  
  Whether the item UI will close when the item is used (typically set to true for consumables).

- **`durability`** (number):  
  The durability of items that wear down over time, such as weapons or tools.

- **`usable`** (boolean):  
  If true, the item is removed on use.

- **`throwItem`** (boolean):  
  If true, the item is a throwable item, such as grenades or Molotov cocktails.

- **`onUse`** (function):  
  A function that is executed when the item is used (e.g., healing, applying a buff, etc.).

- **`typeAmmo`** (string):  
  The type of ammunition the weapon uses (used for weapons). This links the weapon to specific ammo types, like `"ammo-rifle2"`.

- **`metadata`** (table):  
  Contains additional data specific to the item. This might include serial numbers or other dynamic attributes.

  - **`componentId`** (number):  
    Used for clothing and accessories to define which part of the player's body the item is attached to (e.g., head, pants).
  - **`maleDrawableId`** (number):  
    Used in clothing items to define the drawable model for male characters (e.g., pants, hats).
  - **`femaleDrawableId`** (number):  
    Used in clothing items to define the drawable model for female characters.

- **`exports`** (table):  
  Specifies any exported functions or resources that are shared between client and server, such as custom actions triggered by using the item.
  - **`client`** (table): Contains resource names and export names for client-side exports.
    - **`resourceName`** (string): Defines the resource name for client-side exports.
    - **`exportName`** (string): Defines the export name for client-side exports.
  - **`server`** (table): Contains resource names and export names for server-side exports.
    - **`resourceName`** (string): Defines the resource name for server-side exports.
    - **`exportName`** (string): Defines the export name for server-side exports.

## Example Item

```lua copy
    ["apple"] = {
        itemLabel = "Apple",
        itemWeight = 0.2,
        itemType = "item",
        stackable = true,
        itemRarity = "common",
        description = "A fresh apple that restores a small amount of hunger.",
        closeOnUse = true,
        exports = { client = { resourceName = "LGF_Inventory", exportName = "eatApple" } }
    },


-- Call the Client export like

exports("eatApple", function(data)
    if data then
        print(json.encode(data, { indent = true }))
    end
end)

```
