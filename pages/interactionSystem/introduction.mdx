# LGF Interaction System

The **LGF Interaction System** is a DUI Handler designed to facilitate dynamic interactions with various in-game entities, including pedestrians and vehicles. Built on the **DUI (Draw User Interface)** system, it provides a seamless way for players to interact with the game world through a user-friendly interface. This system leverages the power of NUI (New User Interface) to display interaction menus, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

## Available Interaction Types

- **Create Interaction with Pedestrian** (`createInteractionPed`): Initiates an interaction menu when a player approaches a pedestrian.
- **Create Interaction with Vehicle** (`createInteractionVehicle`): Allows players to interact with nearby vehicles, providing options like opening or closing doors.
- **Create Interaction with Job** (`createInteractionJob`): Enables interaction menus that can only be accessed by players with specific job roles, ensuring that interactions are relevant to the player's current occupation in the game.
- **Close Interaction** (`closeInteraction`): Closes any open interaction menus, ensuring a smooth transition back to normal gameplay.

## Features

- **Dynamic Interaction Points**: Enables interactions with peds and vehicles based on proximity, making the world feel more immersive and responsive.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify interaction options through Lua tables, allowing server owners to tailor the interactions to their specific needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Integrates with NUI for displaying interaction menus, ensuring that players have an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
- **Job-Based Interactions**: The `createInteractionJob` function allows for the creation of interaction menus that are restricted to certain job roles. This adds a layer of role-playing to the game, as only players with the specified jobs can access these interactions.
