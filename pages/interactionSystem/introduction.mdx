# LGF Interaction System

The **LGF Interaction System** is a DUI Handler designed to facilitate dynamic interactions with various in-game entities, including pedestrians and vehicles. Built on the **DUI (Draw User Interface)** system, it provides a seamless way for players to interact with the game world through a user-friendly interface.

- **Create Interaction with Vehicle** (`createInteractionVehicle`): Allows players to interact with nearby vehicles, providing options like opening or closing doors.
- **Close Interaction** (`closeInteraction`): Closes any open interaction menus, ensuring a smooth transition back to normal gameplay.

## Features

- **Dynamic Interaction Points**: Enables interactions with peds and vehicles based on proximity, making the world feel more immersive and responsive.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify interaction options through Lua tables, allowing server owners to tailor the interactions to their specific needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Integrates with NUI for displaying interaction menus, ensuring that players have an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
