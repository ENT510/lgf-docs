# LGF Placable Props

**LGF Placable Props** is a system that allows players to place objects in the game world without directly modifying their inventory. It integrates with the OX Inventory system and uses hooks to manage the objects. Each object is associated with a name and can be configured for advanced interactions such as degradation, inspection, and visualization through graphical interfaces.

## Main Features

### 1. Creation and Synchronization of Objects

Objects are dynamically created and placed in the game world with a unique identifier. They are synchronized across all clients, so every player can see and interact with them.
- Synchronizing Existing Drops
Each time a player loads into the game, the system checks if there are any previously placed objects (drops) and ensures that these are synchronized with the client. This ensures the player can see and interact with objects that were placed before they joined the server.

### 2. Object Customization

Each object can be customized with various properties:

- **Degrade Time**: Each object can have a customizable degradation time, after which it is automatically removed from the game.
- **Inspectability**: Objects can be configured to allow close inspection, providing a detailed view through a virtual camera.

### 3. Use of DUI (Drawables User Interface)

DUIs are used to display a graphical interface above the object. When a player approaches an object, a UI is shown with information and interaction options such as:

- Inspect the object.
- Remove or interact with it in other ways.

This interface is synchronized across all players, enabling smooth and shared management of objects.

### 4. Object Management Functions

- **Creation**: Objects are created in the game and synchronized across all clients.
- **Degradation and Removal**: Degradable objects are automatically removed after a set time.
- **Removal**: Objects can be removed and returned to the player's inventory if necessary.

### 5. Extensive Client and Server Exports

The system offers a wide range of **exports** for both client and server, providing flexibility for developers to integrate and extend the system according to their needs. These exports allow easy interaction and management of placed props, making it highly customizable and extensible.

## Item Structure

You need to specific the item with correct properties

```lua copy
SvConfig.PropsMatching = {
    ["water"] = { -- Item Name
        ModelHash = "prop_ld_flow_bottle", -- Object Prop
        ItemType = "item", -- Item Type: "item" or "weapon"
        IsInspectable = true,                -- If true adds an option that will allow you to inspect the item up close with a camera
        Degradable = false,                  -- Automatically remove the item drop when it degrades
        DegradeTime = { Min = 20, Max = 50 } -- Random time between 20 and 50 minute for degradation
    },

    -- WEAPON

    ["WEAPON_ASSAULTRIFLE"] = {
        ModelHash = "w_ar_assaultrifle",
        ItemType = "weapon",
        IsInspectable = false,
        Degradable = false,
        DegradeTime = false
    },
}
```

## Summary

The **LGF Placable Props** system offers a simple and efficient way to manage objects in the game world. Objects are fully customizable and can be interacted with via a visible UI above them. Thanks to integration with **OX Inventory** and the use of **DUI**, the system provides an immersive and dynamic gameplay experience without requiring direct modifications to the player's inventory.
